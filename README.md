# Credit-Risk-Loan-Approval
The project objective is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify loan applicants as good or bad credit risks. The model should assist the bank executives in making loan approval decisions and reduce the risk of default.

<h1> The scope of the project includes the following: </h1>

- <b> Data collection and pre-processing:</b> This involves obtaining the dataset, cleaning and formatting the data, and preparing it for analysis.

- <b> Exploratory data analysis:</b> This involves understanding the data through visualization and statistical analysis.

- <b> Feature selection:</b> This involves selecting the most relevant features to be included in the predictive model.

- <b> Model development:</b> This involves building, training, and testing several machine learning models to predict credit risk.

- <b> Model evaluation and selection:</b> This involves evaluating the performance of the models and selecting the best model for deployment.

<b> The goal of the project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify loan applicants as good or bad credit risks with a high degree of accuracy. This will reduce the risk of default and improve the bank's profitability.</b>
